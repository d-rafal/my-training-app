This **SPA** is a simple demonstration of usage some of
react's environment libraries, such as:

- react
- redux (Redux Toolkit)
- react-hook-form (in previous commits was formik)
- material-ui

It's based on **Create React App** environment configuration, fully
responsive and written in **Typescript**.

A RESTful communication with a server is mocked within a browser by
using "Mock Service Worker" library.

The intention behind this app is to simplified documentation of a
training progress, providing an interface to store subsequent training
sessions data. As I said, it's only a demonstration, so all data you
provide will be lost when you refresh a page or close a browser.

I will put an effort to progressively add new functionalities to this
app, especially if they would cover usage of new libraries.

You can start playing with it by entering following user credentials:

- email: `user1@user.com`
- password: `123456`

Enjoy!
